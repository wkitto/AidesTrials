# AidesTrials
Three new preventative aides drugs were tested in clinical trials in 2015. The trial designs were modeled after the famous RV_144 Aides Trials in Tailand in 2009. All trial participants were aides free at the start of trials.   Analyze and report on the apparent effectiveness of the three different drugs. Does sex of the participant seem to be a factor for any of the drugs? How about being LGBT or a drug user? Which if any drug would you recommend or tell to avoid for a 32 year old female?  How about a 27 year old male? Does being a drug user or a member of the LGBT community change your recommendations?
